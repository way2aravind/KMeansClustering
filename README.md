# 75DaysChallenge - Day 16: K-Means Clustering

## Description
This repository is part of my ongoing #75DaysChallenge journey, where I explore and implement various machine learning techniques. Day 16 covers the concept of **K-Means Clustering**, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm. The notebook demonstrates how to apply K-Means to the Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.

## Project Structure
- `KMeans_Clustering.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset.
- `KMeans_Clustering.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation explaining K-Means clustering, the Iris dataset, and the steps involved in the clustering process.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required libraries:
3. Open `KMeans_Clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the code cells to apply K-Means clustering to the Iris dataset.

## Key Concepts
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised algorithm used to partition data into K clusters based on similarity.
- **Iris Dataset**: A well-known dataset containing features of different Iris species used for classification and clustering tasks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering works, and how it can be applied to real-world datasets for exploratory data analysis. The visualization shows the distribution of clusters and their centroids, providing insights into how the algorithm groups similar data points together.
